## Cloud SQL for SQL Server MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to a Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables**: The extension requires the following environment variables to be set before the Gemini CLI is started:

    *   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT`: The GCP project ID.
    *   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_REGION`: The region of your Cloud SQL instance.
    *   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_INSTANCE`: The ID of your Cloud SQL instance.
    *   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
    *   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_IP_ADDRESS`: The IP address of the Cloud SQL instance.
    *   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_USER`: The database username.
    *   `CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PASSWORD`: The password for the database user.

2.  **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${CLOUD_SQL_MSSQL_PROJECT}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3.  **Handle Permission Errors**: If you encounter permission errors, ensure the user has the **Cloud SQL Client** (`roles/cloudsql.client`) role and the correct database-level permissions. You can provide these links for assistance:
